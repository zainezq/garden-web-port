Some information relating to the current workflow (we'll see how long this lasts).

- Book notes → Anytype (Notion alternative)
- To dos (managed via org capture and shown in org agenda) → Emacs + Org
- Calendar (using org capture and shows on org agenda) → Emacs + Org
- DG (digital garden - currently using quartz and is public) → Emacs + Quartz
- Blogs (personal website) → Emacs
- Personal notes (org roam stuff) → Emacs + Org Roam

Write the notes first in org-roam, then they will be published to the digital garden or the blog.

### Changes Made

- [05-06-2025] Used SiYuan before as a Notion alternative, it's absolutely fantastic, but the only complaint (and
  reason for changing) is the fact that it doesn't have a free syncing functionality. Thus, I switched over to Anytype.
