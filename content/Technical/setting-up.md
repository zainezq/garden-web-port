# Introduction

After finishing University, I came to realise that I was actually implementing most of what I learned in the [[advanced-networking.md | Advanced Networking]] module, namely the DNS section of it. Thus began the rabbit hole, where I wanted to take more control over the domain that I was using to host my website [zainezq.com](https://zainezq.com).

I purchased the domain name at the end of 2024, right before new years, for around Â£10. At the time I was hosting the website mentionned above using Vercel and the domain name was bought through them, so essentially I didn't *have* to even do anything beside push to GitHub.
