# Introduction
Upon completing the book titled "The Science of Self-Discipline" written by Peter Hollins, I wanted to write a 
little summary of the lessons the book has to offer. 

# Purpose

The purpose of the book is to provide a framework for those wanting to build and maintain self-discipline in their 
daily routine, through science-based advice and strategies. 

# Biological Basis of Self-Discipline

One of the first quotes given in the book is from Jim Rohn, who states that:

>  “We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.”

The very first chapter talks about the biology behind self-discipline. The reason for discussing this is that 
without having an understanding of the things that cause, diminish or strengthen self-discipline, it would be 
difficult to benefit from it. The concept of [[neuroplasticity | neuroplasticity]] is mentioned in the book, which 
enables change. Our brain's ability to form and reorganise neural connections alludes to the fact that 
self-discipline can be developed and improved over time. The example used is that of a road being taken to and from 
work every single day. The more often this road is taken, the more automatic the journey becomes, up to a point 
where you will be able to get through it without conscious thought.

Another important point raised is the concept of *willpower fatigue*. Self-discipline and willpower are not two 
static quantities that are fixed, they are like gas in a tank, it can be drained or replenished. Essentially this 
emphasises the point that no matter how great somebody's willpower is, it will eventually deplete. How does one 
combat this then? One should prioritise important tasks when the willpower is at its highest, larger tasks should be 
broken down into smaller ones, and self-care should be practiced to replenish willpower.

# Two Rules:

## The 40% Rule

This rule was developed by Navy SEALs, and states that when you feel like you've reached your mental or physical 
limit, the reality is that you've only reached about 40% of your true capacity. This rule allows you to create a 
shift in your mindset. Perceived limitations are no longer ones maximum capacity, but rather, this shift pushes you 
to tap into hidden reserves and maximises your potential.

## 10-Minute Rule

If you ever felt like you crave something, and the urge pushes you to it, the 10 minute rules states that you should 
wait for 10 minutes before getting it. If you want to eat a sugary snack, wait for 10 minutes before getting it. 
This exercise removes the 'immediate' from immediate gratification, and more-so shows that you *can* withstand your 
urges.

# Discipline Drainers

The author then goes on to mention common discipline drainers, and how to overcome them. 

## False Hope Syndrome

Instead of setting unrealistic expectations, set smaller achievable goals, and celebrate the wins along the way. If 
you were to do the former, it can quickly lead to disappointment and a decrease in motivation. The latter approach 
will give you the sense of accomplishment, build self-confidence and increase momentum, which is more sustainable 
over time.

## Procrastination

To improve self-discipline, procrastination should be avoided, one should stop waiting to *be ready* or for 
everything to feel *just right*. Inaction goes hand in hand with making excuses, and ultimately sabotages the 
chances of you getting the thing you want done. The 75% rule was mentioned, where you take action when you are 75% 
certain of success. Embracing the imperfection allows you to act, and this action enables you to improve 
self-discipline.

# Flex your Uncomfortable muscle

By nature self-discipline is uncomfortable. If you were given the choice to play video games or run a mile, most 
would choose the former, simply because it is *easier*. Methods such as [[urge-surfing | urge surfing]], seeking out 
challenges and practicing discomfort are mentioned here that would allow you to develop self-discipline. 

# Create a Disciplined Environment

The next chapter of the book states that having an environment that is conducive to self-discipline is one of the 
most effective and simplest ways to drastically improve ones life. How does one do this? The author lists and 
explains ways to create such an environment. From amongst them are: 
- Minimising Distractions: essentially you create a clutter-free working environment, and focus on the 'out of sight,
  out of mind' principle
- Regulate Dopamine: being mindful of the cues that trigger dopamine release, such as junk food, social media etc. 
  and instead creating a reward system that enforces positive behaviour and habits
- Optimise default choices: simply put, this is streamlining disciplined behaviour and choosing the path of least 
  resistance

# Delayed Gratification

This chapter was titled 'Why You Should Always Eat Your Vegetables First', and, as one can tell, this is talking 
about the art of delaying gratification. The author goes on to explain how this works, and goes back to the
[[stanford-marshmallow | Stanford Marshmallow Experiment]]. Two ways one can delay gratification are:
- Visualising your future self: research goes on to state that there is a strong correlation between visualising 
  your future self and making better long-term decisions. This is simply putting yourself in the shoes of your 
  future self and imagining what you will be doing in the future
- The 10-10-10 Rule: a question to pose to oneself, asking 'how will I feel in 10 minutes, 10 hours and 10 days?'. 
  This question forces a perspective shift and can allow you to prioritise long-term benefits over short-term 
  satisfactions

# Using targeted questions 

> If you make the effort to ask yourself these four questions and to be
honest in your answers, you’ll become more aware of your tendencies to
rationalize and make excuses, and you’ll be prepared to create better
habits for leading a disciplined life.

The four questions are as follows:

1. Do I want to be a disciplined person or not?
2. Am I doing the right thing or simply what’s easy?
3. These are the vegetables, so what am I getting for dessert?
4. Am I being self-aware?

# Mindset and Approach

This chapter talks about how our mindset can affect weather we positively or negatively perceive our lives. Some of 
the ways one can take on a more positive and optimistic outlook on life are:
- The Endowed Progress Effect: perceiving advancements can make us feel more motivated and optimistic, one can do 
  this by recognising and acknowledging progress in the past towards a goal
- Goal Proximity: the idea that the closer we are to a goal, the more motivated we are to reach it.
- Think of How Your Actions Can Benefit Others: when one considers how their actions can benefit others, this can 
  quickly turn into a strong source of motivation and drive
- Think Optimistically: by thinking optimistically, one can create a positive and optimistic outlook on life. The 
  term used in the book is 'hoping for the best while preparing for the worst'
- Think in Terms of Effort: focus on the effort, not the outcome. When one does this, they are able to enjoy the 
  process regardless of the outcome

# Build Routines and Habits

Motivation is nice to have, but it is something that fluctuates based on emotion and circumstances. Habits on the 
other hand, are something concrete and can be built and maintained. Research has shown that it takes 66 days to 
build a habit, and requires self-discipline to get through that process. But once it is built, this habit will drive 
you instead. The final thing mentioned in the book is the six sources of influence model by Joseph Grenny. These 
factors are (1) personal motivation, (2) personal ability, (3) social motivation, (4) social ability, (5) structural 
motivation, and (6) structural ability. 

# Summary

This book is a great read, and taught me a lot about self-discipline and the science behind it. I would definitely 
recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their self-discipline. It is, however, something that should be 
reflected upon, not all the approaches and strategies are a one-size-fits-all, thus, take it with a grain of salt and 
adapt it to your own circumstances.
